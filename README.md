# HackingToolkit9DS

Using this fork, You can use HackingToolkit9DS without installing.

With this tool, you'll be able to:
- Extract and rebuild any .3DS file
- Extract and rebuild any .CIA file (No DLC nor DSiWare atm)
- Extract and rebuild a 3DS banner file (shown on the 3DS home menu)
- Extract any ncch partition
- Extract contents from a decrypted ncch binary file

Before report an issue, be sure:
- Your 3DS|CIA file is clean and not decrypted by Decrypt9 or GodMode9.
- Your 3DS|CIA file doesn't have any space or special character in its name (such as é or à).
- Your 3DS|CIA file is in the same folder as batch files.
